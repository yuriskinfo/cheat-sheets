== Connect to remote FTP server specifying username and password on the command line
WARNING: This means that username/password can be seen by other users logged in on the machine (if any)

[source,bash]
----
ncftp -u ftpuser -p qwe123 ftp.slackware.com
----

.Here:
* -u _user_: specify username on the FTP server
* -p _password_: specify password of FTP user
* ftp.slackware.com: FTP server domain name or IP address to connect to.

After connecting we can issue FTP client commands on the prompt.


== Upload a file renaming it at the destination
`ncftp` will not upload a file if a file with the same name exists in the destination server. To still upload such file, we can rename it using `-z` option.
Upload file named _manifesto-1.pdf_ to the FTP server renaming it to _manifesto-2.pdf_

[source,bash]
----
ncftp / > put -z manifesto-1.pdf manifesto-2.pdf
manifesto-1.pdf:                                        11.40 kB    2.49 MB/s
