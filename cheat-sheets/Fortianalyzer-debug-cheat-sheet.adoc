|*diagnose system route list*, *diagnose sys route6 list*
|Show routing table



|*diagnose test application oftpd 3*
|List all devices sending logs to the Fortianalyzer with their IP addresses, serial numbers, _uptime_ meaning connection establishment uptime, not remote device uptime, and packets received (should be growing).

*diagnose debug enable*
|Real time debug of communicating with the __Device name__ device.

|*diagnose sniffer packet any "host __IP of remote device__"*
|Sniff packets from/to remote device, to make sure they are sending each other packets. The communication is encrypted.

|*diagnose sniffer packet any "port 514"*
|Sniff all packets to/from port 514 used by Fortianalyzer to receive logs from remote devices.

|*diagnose fmnetwork arp list*
|Show ARP table of the FAZ

|*diagnose fmnetwork interface list*
|Show FAZ interfaces with errors, MTU, IP address, analog of ipconfig in Linux.

|*diag test app fortilogd 99*
|Restart the daemon responsible for accepting logs from devices

|*diag test app sqllogd 99*
|Restart daemon responsible for inserting logs into SQL db.
