NOTE: All commands were tested on HP/Aruba 5400 switches (specifically 5406Rzl2), but will work on any model with recent firmware versions (16.x or newer), except for the hardware features unavailable on smaller models, like VSF .


== General Health
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*show system*
|Show general info: current CPU load, uptime, memory used/free, software version.

|*show cpu [_seconds_]*
|Show CPU stats of average load for 1 second, 5 seconds, and 1 minute, optionally setting period in _seconds_ (300 is max).

|*show uptime*
|Show uptime of the switch since reboot, for VSF stacked switches shows uptime for each member.

|*show time*
|Show switch time and date, for log correlation.


|*show flash*
| Show what firmware images are stored in the flash, and which one is the primary/secondary for the next boot.

|*show boot-history*
|Show log of previous boots with their reason (user reboot/cold reboot), crashes and what process crashed with its memory dump, and timestamps.

|*boot system flash primary\|secondary*
|Set the image to boot from on the next reboot.

|*show redundancy [detail]*
|In module management redundancy standalone/stack topology, shows firmware image version of each module, as well as the number of failovers. 

|*show system power-supply [detail]*
|Show statistics of the power supplies: power consumed, power supplied, fan speed,inlet and internal temperature.

|*show system fans*
|Show fans state: OK/Failed, and number of failures if any. For VSF shows info
for both members.

|*show config _option_*
a| Display part of saved configuration given by _option_:

`status`: Tell if the running config differs from the startup config.

`interface` _port-id_: Show startup config for the specified interface.

`router bgp\|ospf\|pim`: Show startup configuration section for this routing protocol.

`vlan` _vlan-id_: Startup configuration for VLAN(s).

|*show modules*
|Show installed modules and their state and serial numbers.

|*show tech [all]*
|WARNING: I bring this command for completeness sake, but this command will run dozens/hundreds of debug commands, printing lots of info, hundreds of pages, which in turn will load the switch as well. Run it with caution, most probably at the HPE support request only.

|*show environment*
|Show the chassis' sensors temperature


|===

== Logs
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

a| Logs severity:

* W=Warning   
* I=Information
* M=Major     
* D=Debug 
* E=Error
| All logs are categorized into severities when written, and the severity is presented in the 1st column of each log. This also
allows filtering logs for display by their severity, see below.


| *show logging -r*
| Show system logs and events in reverse chronological order, i.e. newest logs first.

|*show log -a*
|Show logs from previous boot cycles. HP/Aruba will display only logs since the last boot, by default, but you can add `-a` to any of the log display commands below to work on previous logs as well. 

|*show log _string-to-search_*
|Search and display only logs containing the specified string. The search is *case sensitive*, and no regex - just plain strings with exact match. E.g. to search for logs   containing  the interface _1/B2_: `show log 1/B2`; to search for all bgp-related logs like peer up/down: `show log -r bgp`.

|*show log command [-a]*
|Show log of commands issued by users on CLI. This log is NOT hidden even by 
the `clear log` and records all commands - both configuration and not. So, it will record commands like `ping 8.8.8.8`, `clear log`, `no router bgp`. Adding `-a` will show logs from previous boot cycles.

|*show running-config changes-history [detail]*
|Display history of up to 32 last changes to the configuration, including time of change, IP address if any, event id. This will NOT show what the changes were themselves though.

|*show log -m/-e/-p/-w/-i/-d*
|Show only logs of the specified severity, see above for the available severities.

|*clear log*
|Hides, not deletes, (almost) all logs for the current session. Applying `-a` will still display all logs.

|*show log -s*
|Display logs from the Standby commander/management module in a VSF stack or in standalone switch with management module redundancy.

|*show log -b*
|Show logs with time since boot instead of an absolute date/time format.
|===

|Clear counters on all interfaces.

|*show interface status*
| Show list of all interfaces with info for each: state (Up/Down), Actual Speed, Tagged or not, VLANs configured for the interface (single VLAN for Untagged, `multiple` for Tagged). NOTE: In Cisco world Tagged interface is called *trunk*.

|*display interface [_name_]*
|Show detailed information of an interface: media type, speed/duplex state, MAC address, up/down, max frame size, VLAN id if any untagged set and `.` (dot) for 
multiple tagged VLANs, input/output erros, buffer failures, CRC errors, runts. 

|*show interface display*

WARNING: this command deletes the VLAN specified no matter from which sub-config mode you issue it. That is, even under interface config mode, this will remove all configuration for this VLAN from everywhere.
