:toc:

Author: Yuri Slobodyanyuk, https://www.linkedin.com/in/yurislobodyanyuk/


NOTE: To enable debug set by any of the commands below, you need to run *diagnose debug enable*. This is assumed and not reminded any further.

NOTE: To disable and stop immediately any debug, run *dia deb res* which is short for *diagnose debug reset*.

NOTE: All debug will run for 30 minutes by default, to increase use `diagnose debug duration <minutes>`, setting to 0 means unlimited by time. Reboot will reset this setting.







== Security rulebase debug (diagnose debug flow)
.Security rulebase diagnostics with `diagnose debug flow`
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*diagnose debug flow filter*
|Show the active filter for the flow debug

|*diagnose debug filter clear*
|Remove any filtering of the debug output set

|*diagnose debug flow filter <filtering param>*
| Set filter for security rulebase processing packets output. You can set multiple filters - act as AND, by issuing this command multiple times. Parameters:

`vd` - id number of the vdom. When entering the vdom with `edit vdom`, this number is shown first.

`vd-name` - limit debug to specific VDOM by its name. Fortigate translates the name to VDOM ID (`vd`).

`proto` - Protocol number.

`addr` - IP address of the packet(s), be it a destination or/and a source.

`saddr` - IP source address of the packet(s).

`daddr` - IP destination address of the packet(s).

`port` - Source or/and destination port in the packet(s).

`sport` - Source port of the packet(s).

`dport` - Destination port of the packet(s).

`negate <parameter>` - negate the match, i.e. match if a packet does NOT contain  `<parameter`. Where `parameter` is one of the above: `vd`, `addr`, `saddr`, `port`, `sport`, `dport`

|*diagnose debug filter6 <parameter>*
| Same as `diagnose debug filter` but for IPv6 packets. The rest of matching and conditions remain of the same syntax.

|*diagnose debug flow show function-name enable*
|Show function names responsible for each step in processing.

|*diagnose debug flow trace start [number]*
|Actually start the debug with optional `number` to limit number of packets traced.

== General Health, CPU, and Memory
.General Health, CPU, and Memory loads
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*get sys stat*
|Get statistics about the Fortigate device: FortiOS used, license status, Operation mode, VDOMs configured, last update dates for AntiVirus, IPS, Application Control databases.

|*get sys performance stat*
|Show real-time operational statistics: CPU load per CPU, memory usage, average network/session, uptime.

|*diagnose debug crashlog read*
| Display crash log. Records all daemons crashes and restarts. Some daemons are more critical than others.

|*diagnose debug crashlog clear*
| Clear the crash log.

|*get hardware memory*
| Show memory statistics: free, cached, swap, shared 

|*execute sensor list*
|List current readings of all sensors present on this model of the Fortigate. ALrger models (1500 and up) show CPUs voltage, fan speeds, temperature, power supply voltage and more.

|===


== Session stateful table

[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*get system session status*
|Show current number of sessions passing the Fortigate. Run inside the VDOM in multi-vdom environment to get number of connections/sessions for this specific VDOM. 



|===


== High Availability Clustering debug
.HA Clustering related debug and verification
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*get sys ha status*
|Show general status and statistics of the clustering - health status, cluster uptime, last cluster state change, reason for selecting the current master, configuration status of each member (`in-sync/out-of-sync`), usage stats (average CPU, memory, session number), status (`up/down`, `duplex/speed`, `packets received/dropped`) for the heartbeat interface(s), HA cluster index (used to enter the secondary member CLI with `exe ha manage`).

|*diagnose sys ha dump-by group*
| Print detailed info per cluster group, shows actual uptime of each member in `start_time`, as well monitored links failures, status.


|*diagnose sys ha checksum cluster*
|Shows configuration checksum for each cluster member separated in individual VDOMs and _global_. In properly synchronized cluster all member checksums should be identical, look at `all` value. 

|*diagnose sys ha checksum recalculate*
|Force cluster member to recalculate checksums, often will solve the out of sync problem. No adverse effects. Run on each cluster member. 

|*diagnose sys ha checksum show <__VDOM__/global>*
|Print detailed synchronization status for each configuration part. Use after seeing `out-of-sync` in *diagnose sys ha checksum cluster* to know which part of configuration causes members to be out-of-sync. Need to run on each cluster member and compare, long output - use `diff`/`vimdiff/Notepad++ Compare plugin` to spot the differences.

|*diagnose sys ha checksum show <__VDOM__/global> <settings part name>*
|Show exact setting inside the settings tree that causes out-of-sync. Use output from *diagnose sys ha checksum show* (see above) for _settings part name_. E.g. if `diagnose sys ha checksum show root` indicates that _firewall.vip_ is out-of-sync, running `diagnose sys ha checksum show root firewall.vip` will give checksums of each VIP in the root domain to compare with those of secondary member.


|*diagnose debug app hatalk -1*
|Enable heartbeat communications debug. It shows in real time if members are talking over sync interfaces. 
The output will look like `state/chg_time/now=2(work)/1610773657/1617606630`, where the desired `state` is _work_, _chg\_time_ is last cluster state/failover date in epoch, and _now_ is the last time communication occurred on heartbeat interface(s), also in epoch. 

|*diag debug application hasync -1* 
|Real time synchronization between members. As only things that changed get synchronized after 1st sync is established, may take time to produce output. See next.

|*execute ha synchronize stop*

*diag debug enable*

*diag debug application hasync -1*

*execute ha synchronize start*

|Stop, enable debug, then start again HA synchronization process, will produce lots of output.


|*exe ha manage ?*

*exe ha manage <id>*

|First show index of all Fortigate cluster members, then enter any secondary member CLI via its index.

|*diagnose firewall proute list*
|List ALL Policy Based Routes (PBR). SD-WAN in Fortigate, after all, is implemented as a variation of PBR. This command lists manual (classic) PBR rules, along with SD-WAN created via SD-WAN rules. *Important*: Manually created PBR rules (via `Network -> Policy Routes` or on CLI `config route policy` always have preference over the SD-WAN rules, and this command will show them higher up.

== SIP ALG and helper
.SIP proxy or helper debug
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*config sys settings*

*get \| grep alg*

|Show the current SIP inspection mode. If the output is `default-voip-alg-mode: proxy-based` then the full Layer 7 
proxy SIP inspection is on (_ALG_ inspection). If the output is `default-voip-alg-mode: kernel-helper-based` then the Layer 4 _helper_ inspection is on. In both modes Fortigate does IP address translation inside SIP packets (if needed), and opens dynamically high ports for incoming media/voice streams ports. In _ALG_ mode, the Fortigate additionally does RFC compliance verification and more. So, the _ALG_ mode is more prone to cause issues but also provides more security.

|*show system session-helper \| grep sip -f*
|If using SIP _helper_ and not _ALG_, make sure there is an entry for SIP in the helpers list, usually on port 5060, but may be custom as well.
