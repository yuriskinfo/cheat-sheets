== Controlling scripts themselves
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|*rem*
|Start a comment, till the end of line. It can be used to comment out a whole line or part of it.

|*cls*
|Clear the screen buffer.

|*echo _text to display_*

*echo off/on*

*echo.*
|Print text on line, or, with `off/on` switch without text, turn off/on echoing the commands being run. 
Usually, you set `echo off` as the 1st line in a batch script, and the `echo on` as the last line. Turning
echoing off does not hide _output_ of the commands run, just the commands themselves. The 3rd option is `echo` followed immediately
by _dot_ and it causes echo to print a blank line (an dthis is the only way to do so).

|*@*
|Turn off echoing only for the command preceded by this @. E.g. `@echo off` to prevent the _echo off_ 
being printed itself.

|*title _Title bar text_*
|Change the title of the cmd.exe window for this session. As a rule of a good style, change _title_ on each stage of the 
script, to let users know what the script is doing.

== Script arguments
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|%_n_
|Positional argument to the script from the command line. _n_ can be from 0 to 9.

|%0
|The script name.  The actual arguments to the script start with %1.
E.g. `echo The script was called as %0, with the %1 as the first argument`

|%*
|The rest of the positional arguments after the 9th altogether. The individual args are not accessible directly, use `SHIFT`-ing.

|*shift [/_n_]*
|Shift positional arguments by one. If `/n` is given, will shift starting with n+1. E.g. `shift /4` will shift 5th to become 4th, 
6th will become 5th, and so on, while arguments before 4 will stay untouched.
