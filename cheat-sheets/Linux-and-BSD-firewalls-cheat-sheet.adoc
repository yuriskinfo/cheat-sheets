|Parse security rules stored in a file without installing them (dry run).

|*pass in quick on egress from 62.13.77.141 to any*
| 'Quick' rule (means allows this traffic on all interfaces, otherwise we would need 2nd rule allowing this traffic in _outgoing_ direction on egress interface) to allow incoming ANY port/protocol with the source being `62.13.77.141` and destination being ANY IP address behind the PF firewall. NOTE: here, `egress` is not a direction, but a group name to which the interface in question (`em0`) belongs to. In OpenBSD you set it in a file `/etc/hostname.em0: group egress` or in real-time with the command: `ifconfig em0 group egress`.
